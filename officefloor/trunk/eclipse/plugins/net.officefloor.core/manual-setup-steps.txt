Manual setup steps to compile net.officefloor.core



BACKGROUND
net.officefloor.core requires an Eclipse install to access the necessary
plugin jars to run various aspects of PDE (including build scripts). Maven
currently (version 2.x, though coming 3.x) can not interrogate Eclipse
plugin repositories to obtain the necessary dependencies.  

It is therefore required to manually download and create an Eclipse install
that can be pointed to be by your maven settings.xml file.  See error message
when trying to run for more information.



INSTALL Eclipse

  1) Download eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org). Ensure select a download that
includes GEF plugin.
  
  2) Install eclipse.
  
  3) Copy the below plugin jar to the top level of the eclipse install and 
rename it to 'startup.jar' (this is necessary fix to run PDE scripts that
were built for previous versions of Eclipse before it started using P2):
  
   plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_xxx.jar

  4) Configure the location of the eclipse install in your maven settings 
file (~/.m2/settings.xml) as per the error message you should now get on
attempting to compile this project.
