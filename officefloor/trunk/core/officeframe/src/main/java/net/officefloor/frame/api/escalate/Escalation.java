 * <p>
 * An escalation is &quot;thrown&quot; (escalated) on processing of {@link Task}
 * and {@link Duty} instances.
 * <p>
 * They are not &quot;thrown&quot; in the sense of a java {@link Throwable}
 * though act similar by the execution path looking upwards in the {@link JobSequence}
 * for an {@link EscalationFlow}/{@link EscalationHandler} to handle it.
 * <p>
 * Typically they are escalated on timing out of processing.
 * <p>
 * {@link Escalation} extends {@link Throwable} so that generic handlers can be
 * written to handle all types of failures - rather than having to have separate
 * handling for {@link Throwable} and {@link Escalation}.
