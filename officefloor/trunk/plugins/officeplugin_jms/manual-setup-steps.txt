Manual setup steps to compile officeplugin_jms



BACKGROUND
officeplugin_jms requires jms-1.1 jar which is not available within the 
maven repositories.  This is due to licensing issues (not technical).

It is therefore required to manually obtain jms-1.1 (agreeing to the
licensing agreements) and manually install it into your maven repository
to make it available for compilation.

INSTALL jms-1.1

  1) Download jms-1.1 from sun web site (or possibly in time to come Oracle)
  
  2) Rename the jms-1.1 jar to jms-1.1.jar
  
  3) Run the following command from the directory containing jms-1.1.jar to 
install it into your maven repository:

   mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jms-1.1.jar -DgroupId=javax.jms -DartifactId=jms -Dversion=1.1 -Dpackaging=jar

  4) Recompiling the project should now pick up the jar
