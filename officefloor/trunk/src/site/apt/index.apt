  <<Welcome to OfficeFloor>>

  OfficeFloor simplifies the development of high performance systems.  It uses a {{{OfficeFrame/job-based-architecture.html}job based architecture}} and manages application functionality with {{{net.officefloor.core/index.html}graphical configuration}}, so that:

   * developers can get back to the enjoyment of writing code rather than configuration

   * architects can tune applications to the hardware they are running on

   * the business can get transparency into their applications to ensure correctness - which leads to reduced costs
