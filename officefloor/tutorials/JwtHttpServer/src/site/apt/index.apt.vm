Combined JWT Resource and Authority Tutorial

  For smaller applications, the JWT Resource (application) server and JWT Authority server may be combined.

  This tutorial demonstrates combining them.

*WoOF configuration

  The configuration contains both the {{{../JwtResourceHttpServer/index.html}JWT Resource}} and {{{../JwtAuthorityHttpServer/index.html}JWT Authority}}.  It is joined by the {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/web/jwt/authority/combined/CombinedServerRetrieveValidateKeysSectionSource.html}CombinedServerRetrieveValidateKeysSectionSource}} that handles the JWT keys being loaded from the {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/web/jwt/authority/JwtAuthority.html}JwtAuthority}}.

  As the JWT Authority can be clustered, it allows the application to also be clustered.
    

*Testing

  The following shows the ease of using the application:
