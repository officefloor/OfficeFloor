R2DBC Tutorial

  This tutorial demonstrates using {{{https://r2dbc.io}R2DBC}} logic within WoOF.
  
  It is a simple application to retrieve data from a database.  As such, the configuration for this tutorial is the following:

  {{{https://github.com/officefloor/OfficeFloor/tree/master/officefloor/tutorials/R2dbcHttpServer}Tutorial Source}}



*Reactive logic

  The following is the R2DBC logic to retrieve the data:
  
%{snippet|id=r2dbc|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/r2dbchttpserver/R2dbcLogic.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  The {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/r2dbc/R2dbcSource.html}R2dbcSource}} provides access to obtain a connection.

  To enable the returned {{{https://projectreactor.io/}Reator}} types to be handled natively by OfficeFloor, add the following:
  
%{snippet|id=reactor|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  OfficeFloor will subscribe to the returned <<<Mono>>>.  The success is passed as parameter to the next procedure (sending it as response):
  
%{snippet|id=send|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/r2dbchttpserver/R2dbcLogic.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}



*R2DBC

  To have the R2DBC available, add the following:
  
%{snippet|id=r2dbc|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  then configure as follows in <<<application.objects>>>:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/resources/application.objects|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  with example properties:
  
%{snippet|file=${basedir}/src/main/resources/datasource.properties|ignoreDownloadError=false}



*Testing

  The following shows invoking the R2DBC code that asynchronously retrieves data:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/test/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/r2dbchttpserver/R2dbcHttpServerTest.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  The {{{../VertxSqlClientHttpServer/index.html}next tutorial}} covers using {{{https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vertx-sql-client}Vertx SQL Client}}.
