Spring HTTP Server Tutorial

  This tutorial demonstrates wiring Spring beans into an OfficeFloor application.

  The following simple output is provided via a Spring bean injected into a WoOF template:

*Spring

  In terms of Inversion of Control, Spring focuses heavily on Dependency Injection.  This makes Spring a very useful library of pre-built objects.  In actuality Spring has provided great abstract APIs across various different vendors for various key services (e.g. {{{http://spring.io/projects/spring-data}Spring Data}}).

  However, Spring is still primarily only a Dependency Injection engine.  It does not provide Continuation Injection nor Thread Injection for modeling functionality and execution of your applications.

  Therefore, rather than re-invent the wheel for these great APIs, OfficeFloor enables integrating Spring in as a {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/compile/spi/supplier/source/SupplierSource.html}SupplierSource}} (supplier of objects for dependency injection).



*Supplier

  Similar to suppliers providing items to a business, a {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/compile/spi/supplier/source/SupplierSource.html}SupplierSource}} supplies objects to OfficeFloor dependency injection.  This is a convenient means for Dependency Injection frameworks, such as Spring, to provide their objects to OfficeFloor.

  The following is the object configuration for this tutorial:

%{snippet|file=${basedir}/src/main/resources/application.objects|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  The {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/spring/SpringSupplierSource.html}SpringSupplierSource}} is configured via it's {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/spring/SpringSupplierSourceService.html}SPRING}} alias.

  Similar to {{{http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot}Spring Boot}} applications, a configuration class loads the Spring beans.  The configured class is as follows:

%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/springhttpserver/SpringBootConfiguration.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  This provides the following single Spring bean for dependency injection via class path scanning:

%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/springhttpserver/HelloBean.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  The {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/spring/SpringSupplierSource.html}SpringSupplierSource}} interogates all the registered Spring beans and makes them available for auto-wiring within OfficeFloor.

  Therefore, the template logic to use the Spring beans is no different to WoOF dependency injection of {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/frame/api/managedobject/source/ManagedObjectSource.html}ManagedObjectSource}} instances:

%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/springhttpserver/Template.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  with the very simple template to output the bean's introduction as follows:

%{snippet|file=${basedir}/src/main/resources/Template.woof.html|ignoreDownloadError=false}



*Spring depending on OfficeFloor

  In the previous section, the Spring bean required a dependency to be injected.  This dependency is provided by an OfficeFloor {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/frame/api/managedobject/source/ManagedObjectSource.html}ManagedObjectSource}}.  This enables:

    * OfficeFloor to depend on Spring beans

    * Spring beans to depend on the richer OfficeFloor {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/frame/api/managedobject/source/ManagedObjectSource.html}ManagedObjectSource}} instances

  Looking at the Spring Boot configuration class again:

%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/springhttpserver/SpringBootConfiguration.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  The dependency is provided from the {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/spring/SpringSupplierSource.html}SpringSupplierSource}}.  This enables Spring factory methods to create beans from {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/frame/api/managedobject/source/ManagedObjectSource.html}ManagedObjectSource}} instances within OfficeFloor.

  From the application object configuration above, this resolves to the following:

%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/springhttpserver/World.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  Note that exposed objects from OfficeFloor must be via an interface.  The interface for this tutorial is:

%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/springhttpserver/Other.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  Typically, Spring depending on OfficeFloor objects should be used sparingly.  In most cases, dependency should be single direction of OfficeFloor depending on Spring beans.  However, the above reverse in dependency direction is available for more complex situations (e.g. staged migration of Spring beans into {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/frame/api/managedobject/source/ManagedObjectSource.html}ManagedObjectSource}} instances to avoid <big bang> changes).



*Building the application

  Due to Spring Boot generating meta-data about the application to run, the following should be used to build the executable jar:
  
%{snippet|id=spring|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  This ensures Spring Boot can generate the necessary meta-data, while still allowing OfficeFloor to manage the execution.  It also keeps the original jar (via the classifier) to allow using as a dependency in larger applications.


*Unit Test

  Suppliers are integrated into OfficeFloor, so the application can be tested just like any other WoOF application:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/test/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/springhttpserver/SpringHttpServerTest.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}
