Google App Engine Tutorial

  This tutorial demonstrates running within {{{https://cloud.google.com/appengine}Google App Engine}}.

  {{{https://github.com/officefloor/OfficeFloor/tree/master/officefloor/tutorials/GoogleAppEngineHttpServer}Tutorial Source}}



*Google App Engine

  The configuration is just like any other Servlet application deployed to Google App Engine:
  
   * The application is packaged as a <<<war>>>
   
   * There is an empty <<<web.xml>>>:
   
%{snippet|file=${basedir}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}
 
   * Along with the <<<appengine-web.xml>>> file, which for this tutorial is the following simple example:
   
%{snippet|file=${basedir}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  Note: see {{{https://cloud.google.com/java/docs}Google App Engine documentation}} for further configuration.


*WoOF

  To configure to run within GCP, simply add the following dependency:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  This then runs the application as any other Servlet application within the Google App Engine.


*Deploying

  Google App Engine tooling can be used as normal to deploy the application:
  
%{snippet|id=deploy|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}


*Testing

  Again the Google App Engine tooling can be used for testing.  This allows testing simple applications:
  
%{snippet|id=simple|file=${basedir}/src/test/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/googleappenginehttpserver/GoogleAppEngineHttpServerIT.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}
  
  However, most applications will require a data store.  To use a local data store requires starting the data store from the command line.  This disallows easy use within continuous integration/delivery pipelines.
  
  OfficeFloor provides the following plugin to undertake integration testing within the Google App Engine emulator with a local data store:
  
%{snippet|id=run|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  To access the data store started, the following test dependency needs to be added:
  
%{snippet|id=integration|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  This allows the application to be integration tested as follows:

%{snippet|id=datastore|file=${basedir}/src/test/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/googleappenginehttpserver/GoogleAppEngineHttpServerIT.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  Furthermore, Google AppEngine emulator only runs HTTP.  There is no secure port.  This makes testing secure end points difficult.
  
  To enable testing of secure connection end points, the OfficeFloor plugin provides a Filter that flags all requests to be secure (avoiding the need for redirects).
  
  This enables the following:

%{snippet|id=secure|file=${basedir}/src/test/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/googleappenginehttpserver/GoogleAppEngineHttpServerIT.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  Note: for running with the Google IDE plugins, the dependency can be also added to the class path to avoid secure redirects:
  
%{snippet|id=secure|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  The {{{../DynamoDbHttpServer/index.html}next tutorial}} covers integrating {{{https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/}DynamoDB}} into OfficeFloor.
