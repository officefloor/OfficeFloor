Reactive Tutorial

  This tutorial demonstrates using Reactive logic within WoOF.

  It will use the {{{/apidocs/net/officefloor/spring/webclient/WebClientManagedObjectSource.html}WebClientManagedObjectSource}} to make an asynchronous call to another REST end point.
  
  To avoid having to start multiple servers, the call will be back onto a REST end point of the same server.  As such, the configuration for this tutorial is the following:

  {{{https://github.com/officefloor/OfficeFloor/tree/master/officefloor/tutorials/ReactorHttpServer}Tutorial Source}}



*Server

  Before getting to the Reactive logic, the Server logic that is called asynchronously is the following:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/reactorhttpserver/ServerLogic.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  With the following response object:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/reactorhttpserver/ServerResponse.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  This is very simple, however, will show how the Reactive logic can call this end point asynchronously.



*Reactive logic

  To enable the returned {{{https://projectreactor.io/}Reator}} types to be handled natively by OfficeFloor, add the following:
  
%{snippet|id=reactor|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  The following is the reactive logic to call the above server:
  
%{snippet|id=reactor|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/reactorhttpserver/ReactorLogic.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  OfficeFloor will subscribe to the returned <<<Mono>>>.  The success is passed as parameter to the next procedure (sending it as response):
  
%{snippet|id=send|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/reactorhttpserver/ReactorLogic.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  Should the <<<Mono>>> fail, OfficeFloor will route the exception to the appropriate exception handler.  See {{{../ExceptionHttpServer/index.html}Exception Tutorial}} for more details.   



*Spring WebClient

  To have the Spring WebClient available, add the following:
  
%{snippet|id=webclient|file=${basedir}/pom.xml|ignoreDownloadError=false}

  then configure as follows in <<<application.objects>>>:
  
%{snippet|file=${basedir}/src/main/resources/application.objects|ignoreDownloadError=false}



*Testing

  The following shows invoking the reactive code that asynchronously pulls data from the server:
  
%{snippet|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/test/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/reactorhttpserver/ReactorHttpServerTest.java|ignoreDownloadError=false}
