Why Eclipse?

  Eclipse was choosen as it:
  
   * provides {{{http://www.eclipse.org/gef/}GEF}} for building graphical editors
   
   * is a widely adopted integrated development environment (IDE)
   
   * is open source
   
   * is free
   
  OfficeFloor has been kept modular to allow integration into other IDE's.  Time and effort is the only reasons for not supporting other IDE's.  Please contribute if you would like to see OfficeFloor on alternate IDE's.
