  <<Secure Link Tutorial>>
  
  This tutorial looks at configuring a specific link for a page to only be accessed via a secure channel (HTTPS).
  
  The below example for this tutorial will implement a simple non-secure page to provide login credentials via a secure link.  The simple page for this tutorial is as follows:

  {{{http://sourceforge.net/projects/officefloor/files/maven/maven2/net/officefloor/tutorial/SecureLinkHttpServer/${projectVersion}/SecureLinkHttpServer-${projectVersion}-project.zip/download}Download Tutorial Source}}



HTML

  The page template content is as follows.  Please note the link in the form action.

%{code-snippet|brush=xml|file=${basedir}/src/main/webapp/template.woof.html}



Secure Link

  To configure the link (form action) to always be communicated via a secure channel, the following is the configuration:
  
[./images/SecureLinkConfiguration-screenshot.png] Secure Link configuration screenshot.

  Adding the link and flagging it secure will ensure WoOF renders the link URL on the page to communicate over a secure channel (HTTPS).  WoOF also prevents non-secure access to the link servicing by responding with a redirect to use a secure channel.
  
  The configuration of links also works in reverse.  Should the Template be configured as secure, adding the link and leaving it unchecked indicates non-secure link.  Note that unless configured, links will follow the template secure setting.



Logic

  The logic for the page is the following:
  
%{code-snippet|brush-autodetect=1|id=tutorial|file=${basedir}/src/main/java/net/officefloor/tutorial/securelinkhttpserver/TemplateLogic.java}

  This tutorial shows sending information over a secure channel (HTTPS) from a non-secure page.  Note that authenticating the login credentials is typically specific to the application/environment and out of focus for this tutorial.



Unit Test

  The unit test demonstrates the rendering of the secure link.
