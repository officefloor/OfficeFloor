  This module provides the core functionality to generate java classes that retrieve beans from a database.  These classes can then be interrogated by ClassWorkSource to be used within OfficeFloor.

  Currently this module provides very limited functionality and other ORMs would better suit application requirements.  The future focus is to provide an ORM that takes advantage of the Job Based Architecture of OfficeFloor with focus on asynchronous database calls.
