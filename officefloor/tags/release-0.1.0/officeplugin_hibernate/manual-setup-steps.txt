Manual setup steps to compile officeplugin_hibernate



BACKGROUND
officeplugin_hibernate requires jta-1.0.1B jar which is not available 
within the maven repositories.  This is due to licensing issues (not 
technical).

It is therefore required to manually obtain jta-1.0.1B (agreeing to the
licensing agreements) and manually install it into your maven repository
to make it available for compilation.

INSTALL jta-1.0.1B

  1) Download jta-1.0.1B from sun web site (or possibly in time to come Oracle)
  
  2) Rename the jta-1.0.1B jar to jta-1.0.1B.jar
  
  3) Run the following command from the directory containing jta-1.0.1B.jar to 
install it into your maven repository:

   mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jta-1.0.1B.jar -DgroupId=javax.transaction -DartifactId=jta -Dversion=1.0.1B -Dpackaging=jar

  4) Recompiling the project should now pick up the jar
