Key improvements from the writer's workshop feedback (and other EuroPlop conversations) is write directly about OfficeFloor and its implementation patterns, simplification of the paper by breaking it into smaller problems (using the grounded theory technique), incorporating the easier to understand office analogies that guided OfficeFloor's design/implementation, avoid overuse of the term "injection", move the "inventor's how" content to an implementation section, avoid distracting content, and focus on the abstract patterns that are the implementation patterns of OfficeFloor.
