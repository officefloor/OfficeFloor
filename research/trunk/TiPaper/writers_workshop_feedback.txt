Key feedback from writer's workshop was: SIMPLIFY!!!, discuss OfficeFloor directly, focus on implementation patterns of OfficeFloor, avoid 'how' discussion, avoid overuse of the word "injection", and avoid the flow configuration diagrams.  On top of this feedback, I listened to myself at EuroPlop explain OfficeFloor (i.e. talking about translation of office patterns to software).  I, therefore, have made the updates to focus on the office implementation patterns of OfficeFloor which are about re-use of office proven patterns in software design.  This creates smaller bites of information to simplify the content of the paper and allows the analogy of what occurs within the office to aid the reader with the low level intricacies of threading/concurrency.  Doing this also addresses the other concerns highlighted in the writer's workshop.
